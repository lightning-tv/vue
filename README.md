# Vue Lightning

Is a framework integration for [Lightning 3 Renderer](https://lightningjs.io/) with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) [Custom Renderer](https://vuejs.org/api/custom-renderer.html). It allows you to declaratively construct lightning nodes with reactive primitives, just as you would construct a DOM tree.

## Not actively maintained

I don't have a lot of time to maintain and update this as most of my time is spent on the [SolidJS](https://github.com/lightning-tv/solid) integration with Lightning. I would recommend using Solid over Vue as Vue3 requires Proxies which won't allow you to target the oldest TV devices still available on the market, plus Solid is faster. If anyone wants updates / tweaks feel free to open an issue and I'll check it out.

## Documentation

Docs coming soon - This is the SolidJS docs but a lot of the features / attributes function the same as with vuejs
