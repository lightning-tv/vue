## Introduction to Rendering in VueJS with Lightning TV

In this snippet, we are utilizing VueJS in conjunction with Lightning TV to render a simple "Hello World" text on the screen. VueJS is a declarative JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, renowned for its performance and fine-grained reactivity. Lightning TV is a framework for building high-performance, animated TV applications. By combining these technologies, we can create dynamic and visually appealing interfaces optimized for TV environments.

```jsx
import { render, Text } from '@lightningtv/solid';

render(() => <Text>Hello World</Text>);
```

## Understanding the Integration of VueJS and Lightning TV

It's very important to understand the concepts of VueJS as that is the primary library for building the UI. VueJS provides the foundation for creating reactive and efficient user interfaces, while the Lightning TV integration merely links VueJS with the Lightning Renderer to create Canvas drawing. This combination allows for the creation of high-performance TV applications with smooth animations and responsive designs.

### Key Concepts in VueJS

To effectively use this integration, familiarize yourself with the core concepts of VueJS:

- **Reactivity**: VueJS uses fine-grained reactivity to update the DOM. This means that only the parts of the DOM that need to change are updated, resulting in highly efficient rendering.
- **Components**: Components are the building blocks of a VueJS application. They are functions that return JSX and can manage their own state and lifecycle.
- **JSX**: VueJS uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. This makes it easy to define UI components declaratively.
- **State Management**: VueJS provides reactive primitives such as signals, stores, and context to manage state within your application.

You can learn more about VueJS from their [documentation](https://docs.vuejs.org/).

## Configuring the Renderer

Before calling the Render function, you can set rendererOptions.

```jsx
import { render, Config, Text } from '@lightningtv/solid';

Config.rendererOptions = {
  coreExtensionModule: coreExtensionModuleUrl,
  numImageWorkers: 2,
  // Set the resolution based on window height
  // 720p = 0.666667, 1080p = 1, 1440p = 1.5, 2160p = 2
  deviceLogicalPixelRatio: window.innerHeight / 1080,
  enableInspector: true,
  // Increase to preload images coming from offscreen
  boundsMargin: 20,
};

render(() => <Text>Hello World</Text>);
```

### Config.rendererOptions

- **appWidth**: Authored logical pixel width of the application.

  - _Default_: `1920`

- **appHeight**: Authored logical pixel height of the application.

  - _Default_: `1080`

- **txMemByteThreshold**: Texture Memory Byte Threshold. When the GPU VRAM used by textures exceeds this threshold, non-visible textures are freed. Set to `0` to disable.

- **boundsMargin**: Bounds margin to extend the boundary for adding a CoreNode as Quad. Can be a single number or an array of four numbers.

- **deviceLogicalPixelRatio**: Factor to convert app-authored logical coordinates to device logical coordinates. Supports auto-scaling for different resolutions.

  - _Default_: `1`

- **devicePhysicalPixelRatio**: Factor to convert device logical coordinates to device physical coordinates. Controls the number of physical pixels used per logical pixel.

  - _Default_: `window.devicePixelRatio`

- **clearColor**: RGBA encoded number for the background color.

  - _Default_: `0x00000000`

- **coreExtensionModule**: Path to a custom core module to use.

  - _Default_: `null`

- **experimental_FinalizationRegistryTextureUsageTracker**: Enables experimental texture usage tracking for garbage collection using FinalizationRegistry. Not recommended for production.

  - _Default_: `false`

- **textureCleanupOptions**: Options for manual texture usage tracking.

- **fpsUpdateInterval**: Interval in milliseconds for receiving FPS updates. Set to `0` to disable.

  - _Default_: `0`

- **enableContextSpy**: Includes WebGL context call information in FPS updates. Significantly impacts performance.

  - _Default_: `false`

- **numImageWorkers**: Number of image workers to use. Improves image loading on multi-core devices. Set to `0` to disable.

  - _Default_: `2`

- **enableInspector**: Enables an inspector to replicate and inspect the state of nodes in the renderer.

  - _Default_: `false`

- **renderMode**: Specifies the rendering mode.
  - Options: `'webgl'`, `'canvas'`
